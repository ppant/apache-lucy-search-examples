# apache-lucy-search-examples
Exploring Perl Apache Lucy search engine. Idea is to put user friendly sample working code with test files. 


ToDo:
* Index HTML document
* Index documents from file system
* Index DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF etc document type. I am not sure but most probably will have to use some test extraction utility like apache Tika.
* Implement facet search
